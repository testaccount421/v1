    <p>This week we are looking at a table setting that has it all. With 
      festive feel to it (only kind that thanksgiving gives you), it has a little 
      bit of everything.</p>
  
    <div id="pimg">
      <img src="images/img1.jpg">
    </div>
  
    <p>Now this text right here is meant to show that there is text here. This is 
  meant to be like a placeholder to text that you might end up putting here. I was 
  able to pick up all the supplies for this at a local store.</p>
  
    <div id="pimg">
      <img src="images/img2.jpg">
    </div>
  
  <p>Sample text sample text sample text sample text, you get the point. I picked up 
  the supplies at a local store for pretty cheap. You like what you see? This is pretty 
  cheap to do. Sample text sample text sample text this is really just filler for 
  this post text. Thank you for understanding. </p>

    <div id="pimg">

  <p>In conclusion, this is a post. I hope you like what you see! Hope to see you back 
  in 20 minutes when I make another test post to see if things work.</p>
